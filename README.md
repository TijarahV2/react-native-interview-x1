# React Native Full Stack Challenge: Blog Post Creator

## Let's Get Started!

Hey there, future teammate! Ready to show off your React Native and Node.js skills? We've got an exciting challenge for you. You'll be building a cool blog post creator app. Let's dive in!

## What You'll Need

- A computer with React Native environment ready to go
- Stable internet connection
- Your favorite code editor
- A fresh React Native project (We love Expo, but React Native CLI is cool too!)
- TypeScript (because we're all about that type safety!)

## The Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create an app where authors can write and manage blog posts. Sounds simple? Well, we've got some twists for you!

## Your Toolkit

- TypeORM with SQLite for local data storage
- React Hook Form or Formik for form management (dealer's choice!)
- Node.js (TypeScript or NestJS preferred) for the backend

## The Journey

1. **Database Setup**
   - Set up TypeORM with SQLite
   - Create models for `Post` and `Author`
   - Link `Post` and `Author` with M-1 relationship

2. **Author Management**
   - Whip up a UI to create and list authors
   - Save and load author data from your local database

3. **Post Central**
   - Create a form to write new posts
   - List all posts with a sneak peek of the content. Show the title and little bit of the content. 
   - Add a delete button to each post (but don't actually delete, just mark as deleted)
   - Load and save all this post goodness using TypeORM

4. **Build the Backend**
   - Create a Node.js backend with APIs to handle post and author data
   - Choose your favorite database for the backend (or just use files if you're feeling old school)

5. **Sync It Up!**
   - Implement the APIs you created in both the posts and author screens
   - Make sure any changes (create or delete) in posts or authors sync immediately with the backend

## The Rules of the Game

- Commit your code after finishing each main step. We love seeing your thought process!
- Keep it simple - use only Expo or React Native CLI for project setup
- Have fun and show us your coding style!

## Ready, Set, Code!

We can't wait to see what you come up with. Good luck, and may the code be with you!
